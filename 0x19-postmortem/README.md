Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was a missing closing tag for the <head> element in the HTML template file. This caused the website's rendering engine to interpret the subsequent content incorrectly, resulting in slow load times and errors.


Timeline:

10:00 AM PST: Initial reports of slow load times and errors received from users.
10:15 AM PST: Monitoring system alerted engineers of increased error rates.
10:30 AM PST: Engineers began investigating the issue, focusing on network connectivity, server performance, and database queries.
11:00 AM PST: Misleading investigation led engineers to believe the issue was related to a database index corruption.
11:30 AM PST: Incident escalated to the development team for further analysis.
12:00 PM PST: Development team identified the missing<head>closing tag as the root cause.
12:15 PM PST: A corrected version of the template file with the missing tag added was deployed to production.
12:30 PM PST: Website performance returned to normal.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The missing closing tag for the <head> element in the HTML template file caused the rendering engine to interpret the subsequent content incorrectly, leading to errors and performance issues. The issue was resolved by adding the missing closing tag to the template file.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Version Control: Implement stricter version control practices to prevent accidental deployment of corrupted files.
Testing: Enhance testing procedures to include thorough checks for HTML syntax errors, including missing closing tags.
Linting: Use HTML linters to automatically detect and report syntax errors, including missing tags.
Monitoring: Expand monitoring capabilities to include specific metrics related to HTML rendering performance.
Backup and Recovery: Maintain regular backups of production files to facilitate rapid recovery in case of data corruption.
Automation: Automate the deployment process to reduce the risk of human error and ensure consistency.
Training: Provide training to development and operations teams on best practices for HTML development, including syntax and structure.
